CS4125 Seminar Research Methodology for Data Science

## Task 1: Gradient-based Image Sharpening
Implement the method for Gradient-based Image Sharpening that was discussed in Lecture 8. The input is an image and parameters 𝑐𝑠 and 𝑐𝑈̅ that control the scaling of the gradients and the term that penalizes the deviation from the input image. The output is the sharpened image.
## Task 2: Gradient-based Image Blending
Implement the method for Gradient-based Image Blending discussed in Lecture 8. The input are one or more source images and selections in the images and a destination image in which the sources are blended. You can implement the method with soft or hard constraints for preserving the pixels of the destination image.
